Corporations are taking new initiatives in managing their environmental impacts in ways that reduce their costs, increase their efficiency, lower their liabilities, and enhance their competitiveness while reducing pollution, conserving resources, and eliminating waste. In the future, significant gains in environmental quality are more likely to come from widespread adoption of pollution prevention practices than from more stringent regulation of end-of-pipe emissions. Bridging the gap between public policy and the trends in private-sector management will require fundamental changes in federal and state governments' approaches to regulation. New policies must use economic incentives to encourage clean manufacturing and the adoption of pollution prevention technologies and forge public-private partnerships for improving environmental quality. © 2000, Sage Publications.

        "content": "New regionalism encompasses a diversity of approaches to address regional planning problems. Within Australia, the Great Barrier Reef Water Quality Protection Plan was developed to enhance water quality within the World Heritage-listed Great Barrier Reef, and the plan gave responsibility to regional, natural resource management bodies to undertake several actions. This paper evaluates these initiatives in the light of the emerging theory of new regionalism and highlights six main lessons: up-scaling of the catchment approach to a reef-wide approach is essential in order to improve water quality, but must be complemented by cross-regional collaboration; new governance and institutional arrangements and strengthened partnerships must be effectively integrated; culture and history are important in determining the most effective management approaches; pilot projects must move to comprehensive and strategic implementation; science is important but needs to incorporate other branches of knowledge; and economic incentives are important in encouraging the implementation of best practices, but delivery needs to be flexible. We conclude that the new regional approach is appropriate for addressing complex, multi-scale problems such as water quality, and has incorporated several key principles of new regionalism, but that the process must move quickly to a higher level of commitment and application. © 2010 The Authors.

        "content": "The traditional policy approaches to encourage conservation, including offering monetary incentives and direct regulation, may lead to unintended consequences which may undermine their effectiveness. In this paper we experimentally test the effectiveness of complementing financial nudging/incentives with nudging for empathy. Our framed experiment models a situation in which an upstream farmer influences the water quality downstream by choosing the level of conservation. Financial nudging is represented by a crop insurance subsidy conditional on conservation compliance (consistent with the 2014 Farm Bill policy). Empathy nudging is represented by a downstream water user sending a message to the upstream farmer encouraging the latter to \"walk-in-the-shoes\"/take the perspective of the former. We found that empathy nudging can counteract the elimination of financial incentives. However, it is less effective than financial nudging. Empathy nudging coupled with financial incentives has a synergic effect and conservation increased significantly compared to using one of the nudges alone. Furthermore, the combination of empathy and financial nudging was particularly effective in low (initial) conservation cases. We argue that policy makers and the public should encourage empathy conservation and that the environmental policy narrative should appeal to empathy and call for farmers to \"join the cause\" for conservation and environmental protection. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",

However the limitations imposed on fungicide use at local and international markets and the demand for alternative postharvest disease management practices has resulted in the search for new approaches for disease control. As a result a new postharvest treatment Hot Water Brushing (HWB) that combines a 15 - 20 s combined hot water spray and fruit brushing was developed by Prusky and co-workers to reduce the incidence of postharvest pathogens and improve mango fruit keeping quality. This technology has enabled to reduce the concentrations of the applied fungicides and the inclusion of new fungicides with reduced toxicity and reduced residues with minimal consumer and environmental risks. However several countries are limiting even further the use of postharvest fungicides. To overcome these limitations new friendly compounds that control fungi infection have been developed. The mode of action of these new compounds is based on the capability to neutralize changes in pH induced by several postharvest pathogens. The new generation of compounds could reduce current fungicide residues and prevent consumer and environmental risks.",

A key target is to achieve rapid adoption of better management practices by landholders, but current theoretical frameworks provide limited guidance about priorities for improving adoption. In this study information from direct surveys with landholders in the two largest catchments draining into the Great Barrier Reef has been collected and analysed. Study outcomes have important implications for policy settings, because they confirm that substantial variations in adoption drivers exist across landholders, enterprises and practices. The results confirm that the three broad barriers to adoption of information gaps, financial incentives and risk perceptions are relevant. This implies that different policy mechanisms, including extension and incentive programs, remain important, although financial incentives were only identified as important to meet capital and transformational costs rather than recurrent costs. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",

        "content": "New crop production technologies developed in response to growing concern over environmental contamination from agriculture may be neither more profitable nor higher yielding than the systems they replace, but they often reduce environmental contamination or improve soil and water quality. Systems designed with environmental objectives cannot be evaluated fairly just by productivity, which is what often is done in economic studies of alternative systems. We review 58 recent studies comparing alternative crop production systems to identify the key criteria for system comparisons, the system characteristics important in designing the analysis, and the methods most suited for comparing alternative systems. The four key criteria we looked for in system comparisons are expected profit, stability of profits, expected environmental impacts, and stability of environmental impacts. Most economic studies of crop production focus exclusively on profitability., and incorporate neither environmental criteria nor the dynamic characteristics inherent in alternative systems. We identify promising new approaches that take account of specific environmental characteristics and attempt to balance the objectives of profitability and environmental risk management. Balanced environmental-economic analysis is most likely to be achieved by integrating biophysical simulation models with economic optimization methods to model the trade-offs among profitability, environmental impact, and system stability (both financial and environmental).",

To achieve this task, the Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR) model is used. The empirical results show that financial development is helpful to improve the water quality but leads to more SO2 emissions in China. In particular, the financial development of China's big cities increases the burden on both air and water quality. Compared with other regions, financial development is influential in improving the environment in developed regions, namely the eastern coast of China. Together with financial development, the impacts of regulations such as “Beijing Olympic Air Control” and “Green Credit Guidelines” have significantly improved the quality of the environment. Moreover, the findings reveal that cities with higher provincial financial sector output have lower SO2 emissions and waste water discharge. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",

        "content": "Nutrient surpluses, inefficiencies in nutrient use, and inevitable leakage of nutrients from grazed animal production systems are putting growing pressure on Australian inland and coastal water resources. While there are some examples of regulatory policy approaches in Australia which aim to reduce nutrient emissions and improve water quality around important and impaired coastal and inland waters, most policy options involve voluntary schemes, often including financial incentives to both industry organisations and farmers to offset the costs of implementing improved management practices. In contrast, much stronger land management regulations have been implemented in the European Union, USA, and to a lesser extent New Zealand. In the near future, greater societal expectations for water quality, stricter standards from international markets, and increasing costs for purchased nutrients will mean that improving nutrient-use efficiency and reducing nutrient losses will be a necessary part of Australia livestock production systems. This is likely to require somewhat varied and difficult choices to better balance production and environmental goals. Policy responses may include voluntary adoption of appropriate nutrient management practices, caps on nutrient inputs, mandatory nutrient surplus targets, limits to stock numbers per hectare, and re-positioning of higher input farms to more resilient parts of the national landscape. Alternatively, society may have to accept that there are unavoidable trade-offs between water quality standards and livestock productivity, with increasing treatment of polluted water at the community's expense.

Despite these measures, concerns about agricultural impacts on water quality persist. Performance-based policy approaches with incentives that are tied to defined outcomes, and not to particular practices, may have an important role in managing water quality. Five performance-based approaches to address water quality in agricultural landscapes were identified: water quality trading/permitting, differentiated payments for ecosystem services, reverse auctions; emissions charges, and cross-compliance (a hybrid measure). The purpose of this paper is to critically assess the institutional and socio-cultural context that facilitated existing performance-based policy instrument adoption. Through this analysis, three key contextual factors were identified as enablers of performance based approaches: (1) social context, (2) institutional capacity and (3) standardized, consistent and robust estimation methodologies. A framework was developed to classify performance based programs and approaches. The application of the findings from this research and the classification framework provide an organized approach to assess the feasibility of implementing performance-based approaches for agri-environmental water quality policy. © 2014 Canadian Water Resources Association.",

The quantification of these impacts, for the current conditions, was carried out in earlier investigations. However, until now, the water quality aspect was not yet considered. In order to include this water quality aspect into the financial and environmental assessment, a quality function was constructed created by comparing water quality parameter values for a current and an alternative treatment process. Four qualifications were assigned to the sum of these scores: \"Worse\", \"Same\", \"Better\" and \"Much better\". The qualifications allowed the comparison of the water quality and the financial and environmental impacts of the selected alternatives using a graphical representation of them. The method was applied focusing on the environmental and financial assessment of six alternative processes for the Loenderveen-Weesperkarspel treatment line, and including the quality aspect, as a third parameter for comparison. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

These approaches are the consumptive approach of the Water Footprint Network (WFN), and the hydrological approach that has recently been published for kiwifruit from New Zealand. Using the hydrological approach, which we consider rational, we find that the water footprint of export apple production from the orchard phase in New Zealand is slightly negative, at-3.3 L/kg, although it can be considered essentially zero. That is, as much water is returned to the blue water resource (B) under the orchards by winter rains, as is withdrawn for irrigation in summer. We conclude therefore that export apple production in New Zealand is sustainable in terms of water quantity. Nonetheless, there is burgeoning pressure on our water resources, and apple growers, along with all others, must be encouraged to reduce further their usage of, and impacts on our water resources. To assist apple growers, we have developed a water-footprint decision support tool to enable eco-verification of apple production and measures of continuous improvement.",

We use data on crop and animal agriculture in the watershed to assess the relative effectiveness of alternative policy approaches for achieving the nutrient and sediment reduction goals of the TMDL, ranging from voluntary financial incentives to regulations. The cost of achieving water quality goals depends heavily on which policy choices are selected and how they are implemented. We found that policies that provide incentives for water quality improvements are the most efficient, assuming necessary information on pollutant delivery is available for each field. Policies that directly encourage adoption of management systems that protect water quality (referred to as design-based) are the most practical, given the limited information that is generally available to farmers and resource agencies.

Currently, overall water quality of the river is very poor, i.e., Class IV (based on the Malaysian water quality standards), mainly due to wastewater discharged from residential area and industries without being properly treated. Due to severe pollution, aquatic ecosystem has not been properly developed. Thus, it is being considered to construct a new wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) to prevent discharge of pollutants and to improve the river water quality. Therefore, this study was conducted to identify the pollution sources along the river and assess their impacts on the water quality. In addition, a numerical model was formulated with the Environmental Fluid Dynamic Code (EFDC) to find a best plan to improve the water quality. Through the model simulation, it was found that wastewater from all the U-drains and culverts along the river should be collected by sewer, transported to a WWTP for treatment, and then pumped to the upstream of the river for discharge. It was also found that if the WWTP would reduce pollution load by 80%, the current water quality of the river would improve by 80% to achieve Class II. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

Coastal water quality and biodiversity are greatly impacted by regional land use. Agricultural land use can have significant impacts on water quality through erosion and the runoff of agricultural chemicals. While the Central Coast region of California is a center for intensive agricultural production, it is also home to the largest marine sanctuary in the United States. This combination has resulted in intensive efforts from government agencies and conservation organizations to reduce pollution associated with agriculture. Efforts have focused on education and incentives, but are recently facing increasing challenges stemming from new standards created by the produce industry in response to food safety concerns. Personal interviews with crop growers were used to explore these challenges and to better understand the range of possible environmental impacts resulting from new food safety standards. Results indicate that substantial management changes are taking place that are likely to impact regional water quality and wildlife. This case study also explores the role of policy networks in shaping management decisions and illustrates how certain approaches to addressing agricultural pollution may be vulnerable to external policy changes. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",

This paper presents a systematic review of early action tools and describes their use in wetland and stream mitigation, species and habitat banking, greenhouse gas mitigation, and water quality trading. It finds that incentives necessary to motivate sellers differ from those motivating buyers. The tool or approach best suited to encourage early action also varies as conditions change.

Over the past decade, pulp and paper companies have continued to focus on minimizing fresh water use and effluent discharges as part of their move towards sustainable operating practices. Three stages-basic conservation, water reuse and water recycling-provide a systematic approach to water resource management. Implementing these stages requires increased financial investment and better utilization of water resources. The ultimate goal for pulp and paper companies is to have effluent-free factories with no negative environmental impact. The traditional water treatment technologies that are used in paper mills are not able to remove recalcitrant contaminants. Therefore, advanced water treatment technologies are being included in industrial wastewater treatment chains aiming to either improve water biodegradability or its final quality. This book discusses various measures being adopted by the pulp and paper industry to reduce water consumption and treatment techniques to treat wastewater to recover it for reuse. The book also examines the emerging technologies for treatment of effluents and presents examples of full-scale installations. Provides thorough and in-depth coverage of advanced treatment technologies which will benefit the industry personnel, pulp manufacturers, researchers and advanced students. Presents new treatment strategies to improve water reuse and fulfill the legislation in force regarding wastewater discharge. Presents viable solutions for pulp and paper manufacturers in terms of wastewater treatment.

Meanwhile, water quality regulations governing discharges of treated municipal wastewater are becoming stricter. California communities are having to upgrade treatment plants to achieve new water quality standards and are searching for creative ways to finance these upgrades. One way some communities are exploring to finance treatment plant upgrades is to obtain, and then sell or transfer water rights to the high-quality recycled water they produce. But historical notions of just “who owns the recycled water” may potentially impede these communities from achieving their goals. This paper explores why California should re-examine historical notions of recycled water ownership and management, and why, fundamentally, recycled water is a “new source” of “developed water” over which POTWs should have total control and rights to. © 2012 Water Environment Federation.",

These decreases are a consequence of an increasing body of evidence that improving dialysate quality positively impacts patient outcomes. Meeting the new microbiological standards could require dialysis facilities to adopt new approaches to managing their water treatment and concentrate preparation systems.

However, there is only limited information to evaluate the spatial and temporal changes to the Huangpu River and its many tributaries. In the present study, 400 citizen scientists were trained to monitor water quality and environmental conditions on a monthly basis over three years in the lower (high urbanized) Huangpu River catchment. Their data were integrated with high resolution land cover data using GIS techniques to characterize water quality dynamics of the Huangpu River system with respect to main environmental drivers. Environmental driver analysis indicated that up-catchment conditions dominate river dynamics while typical urban impacts (first flush, impermeable land cover…) have only limited influence. According to these results, the city's investments to improve wastewater treatment and mitigate lower river impacts need to be extended throughout the catchment to reduce nutrient concentrations that are near or above thresholds for rivers and streams. The positive impact of in-stream vegetation pointed to the possibilities that local scale ecological remediation activities to reduce runoff could be viable approaches to improve river conditions throughout the catchment. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

This saving, which originates from the omission of some obligatory water pollution control investment, the so-called 'unlawful enrichment', is well definable in monetary terms, and can be taken as a basis for comparison in the calculation of fines. Levying fines according to the unlawful enrichment may result in fines which, in a given period, (the economic lifetime of treatment plants) may reach or exceed the illegal savings (capital + operational and maintenance costs). They are thus able to substitute for the otherwise missing economic efficiency of such infrastructural investments on the discharger's side.

The GBR is listed as a World Heritage site for its outstanding universal value, meeting all four natural criteria for listing. Yet the status of its iconic species and ecosystems continues to decline due to poor water quality, climate change and extreme weather events. Concerted efforts by the Australian and Queensland governments to improve water quality over the last 15 years have failed to deliver measurable improvements to the health of inshore ecosystems. In this period, four phases of bilateral water-quality planning and programs have developed scientifically robust targets and reporting systems. Programs have largely relied on suasive mechanisms to facilitate the adoption of improved agricultural practices with lower water-quality risks. Yet even 100% adoption of improved practices will not achieve the water-quality targets necessary to support the GBR in the face of growing climate change impacts. Our conclusion is that, despite the strong science and partnerships that support reef policy and programs, greater effort is needed to overcome constraints to current management approaches and to employ the additional policy measures required to help sustain the GBR into the future. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Numerous policy innovations may improve nonpoint source pollution, but little research has examined which types of individuals are likely to support various runoff reduction policies. We conducted a household mail survey of 1136 residents in southern Wisconsin. In general, residents were more likely to support water quality policies if they were communitarians, egalitarians, concerned about water pollution, and perceived water quality as poor. The majority of respondents somewhat to strongly supported all of the seven proposed water quality policies, but opposed relying on voluntary action without government involvement on farms. Residents had higher support for incentives and market-based approaches (carrot policies) than regulation and taxes (stick policies). A more complicated pattern emerged in within-subject comparisons of residents’ views of carrot and stick approaches. Stick approaches polarized respondents by decreasing support among people with individualistic worldviews, while slightly increasing support among people with communitarian worldviews. Residents with an agricultural occupation were more likely to support voluntary, non-governmental approaches for reducing agricultural runoff, and were also more likely to support regulation for reducing urban lawn runoff. This research highlights the dominant role of cultural worldviews and the secondary roles of water pollution concern, perceived water quality, and self-interest in explaining support for diverse policies to reduce nonpoint source pollution. © 2017",

The main objective is to supply the competing users in a fair way, while the efficiency and environmental sustainability criteria are satisfied and the utilities of water users are incorporated. Firstly, an optimization model is developed to proportionally allocate water to the competing users in water donor and receiving basins based on their water demands. Secondly, for different coalitions of water users, the water shares of the coalitions are determined using an optimization model with economic objectives regarding the physical and environmental constraints of the system. In order to satisfy waterquality requirements, the impacts of decreasing the instream flow in donor basin are estimated using a water-quality simulation model, and the required treatment levels for effluents discharged into the river, downstream of the water transfer point are determined. Finally, to achieve equity and to provide sufficient incentives for water users to participate in the cooperation, some cooperative game theoretic approaches are utilized for reallocation of net benefits to water users. This model is applied to a large-scale interbasin water allocation problem including two different basins struggling with water scarcity in Iran. The results show that this model can be utilized as an effective tool for optimal interbasin water allocation management involving stakeholders with conflicting objectives subject to physical and environmental constraints. © Springer Science + Business Media B.V. 2009.",

This methodology was used to evaluate the impacts of the construction of a new maritime terminal in Sepetiba Bay, Brazil. The methodology quantifies the amount of resuspended sediments and calculates the expected contaminants concentrations in the water column. The results indicated that sediment quality criteria were not compatible with water quality criteria, because the dredging of contaminated sediments does not necessarily yield contaminated water.

* Methodology

** Search

1. Server receive search query
2. Search with Elasticsearch as a
3. Load local rating db as b
4. Combine them b + a
5. Response to user

** Save Rate

1. Server receive rate query
2. Save it
3. Response success of not

** Load Rate

1. Load all local rate from search query
2. response rated data with average rate

* Dev

** Search Response

At ~server.py~, the search function:

https://github.com/nasyxx/nsf4_backend/blob/master/server.py#L78-L103.

First part of it is ~res~ from Elasticsearch response.  We now in this function
only use the ~res["hits"]["total"]~ and the ~res["hits"]["hits"]~.

Second part is ~db_res~ from local rated db.  The structure of it is not the same
as ~res~.  It has an additional dict -- rate.

The ~filter~ function receive a hit and response True of False.  Default of it is
filter title to avoid duplicates with db response and user selected title.  This
response is a dict.  You can easily increase or decrease content by using a
middleware.  You can wrap it.

** Rate

At ~server.py~, the rate function:

https://github.com/nasyxx/nsf4_backend/blob/master/server.py#L114-L134.

If success, then response 0, otherwise response 1.

** Owl

At ~owl.py~, also the rate function:

https://github.com/nasyxx/nsf4_backend/blob/master/server.py#L158-L164.
